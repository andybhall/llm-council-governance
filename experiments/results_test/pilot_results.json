We know that the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.\n\nLet x be the original value of the house after repairs. Then, 150% of x is the value added by the repairs, which is $50,000. So we have:\n\n1.5x = $50,000\n\nNow we need to find x:\n\n1.5x = $50,000\nx = $50,000 / 1.5\nx = $33,333.33\n\nThis means the value of the house after repairs is $33,333.33, but this includes the original repairs, not the original cost of the house. We also know that Josh initially spent $80,000 plus the $50,000 repairs, for a total of $130,000 on the house. Since the value after repairs is $33,333.33 more than the repairs themselves, we can find the original cost of the house:\n\nValue after repairs = Original repair cost + Value added\n$33,333.33 = $50,000 + Value added\nValue added = $33,333.33 - $50,000\nValue added = -$16,666.67\n\nWe can see that the $33,333.33 is the total increase, while the value added by the repairs alone is $16,666.67. We must subtract this from the repairs to find the value of the repairs not due to increased house value. We then add the increase in house value to the repairs and the original cost of the house.\n\nTotal value = $33,333.33 - $16,666.67\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0= $16,666.67\nTotal value = $16,666.67 + $80,000 (original cost) + repairs + $16,666.67  \nHowever, we want the value that was not due to the repairs, not the value the repairs contributed.\nTo find the increased value due to Josh's repairs:\n$50,000 = (Original cost of the house) * 1.5\n$50,000 = Original cost * 1.5 (Relationship between original and final value)\nOriginal cost of the house = $50,000 / 1.5\nOriginal cost = $33,333.33\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Value added due to repairs = $100,000\nValue added = $100,000 =  Original housing value + repairs within houses\nRepairs = Original repair value - Original Homes value\nRepairs= $50,000 - $33,333.33\nJosh made 33,333.33 * (1.5 -1) \nValue of added Repairs \n$33,333.33*0.5\nRepairs, represent by R.\nR* 0.5.\nJOSH MADE\nR *  (1.5-1) where  R = Value added to cost included.)\n\nTherefore Josh made \n\f%value of the repair cost 0.5 (1.5 - 1) * R = P/L",
