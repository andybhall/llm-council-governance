ACCURACY WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
----------------------------------------
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize: 75.0% [30.1%, 95.4%]
  Independent → Majority Vote: 100.0% [51.0%, 100.0%]
  Independent → Deliberate → Vote: 100.0% [51.0%, 100.0%]
  Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: 100.0% [51.0%, 100.0%]

STATISTICAL TESTS
----------------------------------------
  Chi-square test:
    Chi-square statistic: 3.20
    p-value: 0.3618
    Interpretation: No significant difference between structures

PAIRWISE COMPARISONS (Bonferroni corrected)
----------------------------------------
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize vs Independent → Majority Vote: -25.0% (p=1.0000)
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize vs Independent → Deliberate → Vote: -25.0% (p=1.0000)
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize vs Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: -25.0% (p=1.0000)
  Independent → Majority Vote vs Independent → Deliberate → Vote: +0.0% (p=1.0000)
  Independent → Majority Vote vs Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: +0.0% (p=1.0000)
  Independent → Deliberate → Vote vs Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: +0.0% (p=1.0000)

T-TESTS: STRUCTURES VS BEST INDIVIDUAL MODEL
----------------------------------------
  Best individual model: gpt-4.1 (50.0%)

  Rank → Synthesize: 75.0% vs 50.0% (diff=+25.0%, t=1.00, p=0.3910)
  Majority Vote: 100.0% vs 50.0% (diff=+50.0%, t=1.73, p=0.1817)
  Deliberate → Vote: 100.0% vs 50.0% (diff=+50.0%, t=1.73, p=0.1817)
  Deliberate → Synthesize: 100.0% vs 50.0% (diff=+50.0%, t=1.73, p=0.1817)

DELIBERATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
  Answer changes after deliberation:
    Total changes:        2
    Changed to correct:   1
    Changed to wrong:     0
    Net benefit:          +1 answers

  Agreement levels (groupthink indicator):
    Before deliberation:  93.8%
    After deliberation:   96.9%
    Change:               +3.1%

  By model (change rate | fix rate when wrong | break rate when correct):
    gpt-4.1: 25.0% | 50.0% | 0.0%
    gemini-2.5-pro-preview: 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0%
    claude-sonnet-4: 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0%
    grok-3: 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0%

  Interpretation:
    Deliberation increases agreement (potential groupthink)
    Net positive: deliberation fixes more than it breaks (+1)
    Simple majority vote may outperform deliberation by preserving independence

TIMING SUMMARY (seconds)
----------------------------------------
  Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: mean=62.05s, std=35.21s
  Independent → Deliberate → Vote: mean=45.83s, std=21.41s
  Independent → Majority Vote: mean=33.97s, std=20.89s
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize: mean=46.11s, std=9.19s
