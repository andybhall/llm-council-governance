T-TESTS: STRUCTURES VS BEST INDIVIDUAL MODEL
----------------------------------------
  Best individual model: gemma-2-9b-it (82.9%)

  Rank → Synthesize: 82.9% vs 82.9% (diff=+0.0%, t=0.00, p=1.0000)
  Majority Vote: 84.1% vs 85.4% (diff=-1.3%, t=-0.69, p=0.4924)
  Deliberate → Vote: 85.4% vs 84.9% (diff=+0.4%, t=0.19, p=0.8479)
  Deliberate → Synthesize: 84.5% vs 85.8% (diff=-1.3%, t=-0.48, p=0.6319)
  Weighted Majority Vote: 84.2% vs 83.3% (diff=+0.8%, t=0.50, p=0.6181)

DELIBERATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
  Answer changes after deliberation:
    Total changes:        257
    Changed to correct:   146
    Changed to wrong:     90
    Net benefit:          +56 answers

  Agreement levels (groupthink indicator):
    Before deliberation:  87.4%
    After deliberation:   92.9%
    Change:               +5.5%

  By model (change rate | fix rate when wrong | break rate when correct):
    llama-3.1-8b-instruct: 19.3% | 48.3% | 5.8%
    mistral-7b-instruct: 9.2% | 44.2% | 4.2%
    gemma-2-9b-it: 16.1% | 48.6% | 9.8%
    qwen-2.5-7b-instruct: 11.7% | 40.7% | 4.1%

  Interpretation:
    Deliberation increases agreement (potential groupthink)
    Net positive: deliberation fixes more than it breaks (+56)
    Simple majority vote may outperform deliberation by preserving independence

    Independent → Deliberate → Vote: 1
    Independent → Majority Vote: 1
