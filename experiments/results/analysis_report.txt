PAIRED BOOTSTRAP COMPARISONS
----------------------------------------
  Baseline: Majority Vote

  Rank → Synthesize vs baseline: +0.4% [-3.8%, 5.0%]
  Deliberate → Vote vs baseline: +0.8% [-3.8%, 5.8%]
  Deliberate → Synthesize vs baseline: +3.8% [-1.7%, 9.6%]
  Weighted Majority Vote vs baseline: -1.3% [-4.2%, 1.2%]
  Agenda Setter + Veto vs baseline: -1.0% [-6.2%, 4.0%]
  Self-Consistency Vote vs baseline: -1.2% [-7.1%, 4.2%]

T-TESTS: STRUCTURES VS BEST INDIVIDUAL MODEL
----------------------------------------
  Best individual model: sample_7 (85.8%)

  Self-Consistency Vote: 85.8% vs 85.8% (diff=+0.0%, t=0.00, p=1.0000)

DELIBERATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
  Answer changes after deliberation:
    Total changes:        217
    Changed to correct:   122
    Changed to wrong:     72
    Net benefit:          +50 answers

  Agreement levels (groupthink indicator):
    Before deliberation:  90.2%
    After deliberation:   94.2%
    Change:               +4.0%

  By model (change rate | fix rate when wrong | break rate when correct):
    llama-3.1-8b-instruct: 14.9% | 46.9% | 5.6%
    mistral-7b-instruct: 10.1% | 47.6% | 4.3%
    gemma-2-9b-it: 12.1% | 47.9% | 4.0%
    qwen-2.5-7b-instruct: 10.9% | 39.5% | 5.0%

  Interpretation:
    Deliberation increases agreement (potential groupthink)
    Net positive: deliberation fixes more than it breaks (+50)
    Simple majority vote may outperform deliberation by preserving independence

  Influence patterns:
    Most influential (convinced others to change):
      gemma-2-9b-it: 119.7 times
      llama-3.1-8b-instruct: 109.7 times
      qwen-2.5-7b-instruct: 107.5 times
    Most influenced (changed to follow others):
      mistral-7b-instruct: 162.0 times
      gemma-2-9b-it: 84.0 times
      qwen-2.5-7b-instruct: 77.0 times
