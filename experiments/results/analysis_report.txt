T-TESTS: STRUCTURES VS BEST INDIVIDUAL MODEL
----------------------------------------
  Best individual model: gemma-2-9b-it (85.8%)

  Majority Vote: 87.1% vs 85.8% (diff=+1.3%, t=0.65, p=0.5138)
  Rank → Synthesize: 87.4% vs 85.4% (diff=+2.1%, t=1.00, p=0.3183)
  Deliberate → Vote: 87.8% vs 84.8% (diff=+3.0%, t=1.46, p=0.1448)
  Deliberate → Synthesize: 90.8% vs 84.5% (diff=+6.3%, t=3.19, p=0.0016)*
  Weighted Majority Vote: 85.8% vs 86.2% (diff=-0.4%, t=-0.24, p=0.8089)

DELIBERATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
  Answer changes after deliberation:
    Total changes:        217
    Changed to correct:   122
    Changed to wrong:     72
    Net benefit:          +50 answers

  Agreement levels (groupthink indicator):
    Before deliberation:  90.2%
    After deliberation:   94.2%
    Change:               +4.0%

  By model (change rate | fix rate when wrong | break rate when correct):
    llama-3.1-8b-instruct: 14.9% | 46.9% | 5.6%
    mistral-7b-instruct: 10.1% | 47.6% | 4.3%
    gemma-2-9b-it: 12.1% | 47.9% | 4.0%
    qwen-2.5-7b-instruct: 10.9% | 39.5% | 5.0%

  Interpretation:
    Deliberation increases agreement (potential groupthink)
    Net positive: deliberation fixes more than it breaks (+50)
    Simple majority vote may outperform deliberation by preserving independence
