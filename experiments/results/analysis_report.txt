STATISTICAL TESTS
----------------------------------------
  Chi-square test:
    Chi-square statistic: 3.01
    p-value: 0.3907
    Interpretation: No significant difference between structures

PAIRWISE COMPARISONS (McNemar's test, Bonferroni corrected)
----------------------------------------
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize vs Independent → Majority Vote: -5.0% (p=1.0000)
    Discordant pairs: 10 (3 s1 wins, 7 s2 wins)
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize vs Independent → Deliberate → Vote: -7.5% (p=1.0000)
    Discordant pairs: 14 (4 s1 wins, 10 s2 wins)
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize vs Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: -5.0% (p=1.0000)
    Discordant pairs: 10 (3 s1 wins, 7 s2 wins)
  Independent → Majority Vote vs Independent → Deliberate → Vote: -2.5% (p=1.0000)
    Discordant pairs: 8 (3 s1 wins, 5 s2 wins)
  Independent → Majority Vote vs Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: +0.0% (p=1.0000)
    Discordant pairs: 10 (5 s1 wins, 5 s2 wins)
  Independent → Deliberate → Vote vs Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: +2.5% (p=1.0000)
    Discordant pairs: 8 (5 s1 wins, 3 s2 wins)

T-TESTS: STRUCTURES VS BEST INDIVIDUAL MODEL
----------------------------------------
  Best individual model: gemma-2-9b-it (82.9%)

  Rank → Synthesize: 82.1% vs 82.9% (diff=-0.8%, t=-0.34, p=0.7324)
  Majority Vote: 85.0% vs 83.3% (diff=+1.7%, t=0.78, p=0.4339)
  Deliberate → Vote: 87.8% vs 86.1% (diff=+1.7%, t=0.76, p=0.4509)
  Deliberate → Synthesize: 84.7% vs 85.2% (diff=-0.4%, t=-0.17, p=0.8662)

DELIBERATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
  Answer changes after deliberation:
    Total changes:        267
    Changed to correct:   159
    Changed to wrong:     83
    Net benefit:          +76 answers

  Agreement levels (groupthink indicator):
    Before deliberation:  85.9%
    After deliberation:   93.1%
    Change:               +7.1%

  By model (change rate | fix rate when wrong | break rate when correct):
    llama-3.1-8b-instruct: 16.8% | 38.5% | 6.2%
    mistral-7b-instruct: 12.2% | 53.7% | 4.2%
    gemma-2-9b-it: 14.0% | 48.5% | 7.4%
    qwen-2.5-7b-instruct: 16.6% | 52.0% | 4.9%

  Interpretation:
    Deliberation increases agreement (potential groupthink)
    Net positive: deliberation fixes more than it breaks (+76)
    Simple majority vote may outperform deliberation by preserving independence

  Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: mean=22.62s, std=19.29s
  Independent → Deliberate → Vote: mean=22.92s, std=24.35s
  Independent → Majority Vote: mean=18.58s, std=56.01s
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize: mean=20.57s, std=17.52s

  Total errors: 7
    Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: 4
    Independent → Deliberate → Vote: 3
