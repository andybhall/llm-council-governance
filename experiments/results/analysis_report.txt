ACCURACY WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
----------------------------------------
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize: 74.6% [68.7%, 79.7%]
  Independent → Majority Vote: 81.7% [76.3%, 86.1%]
  Independent → Deliberate → Vote: 79.5% [73.9%, 84.1%]
  Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: 78.3% [72.7%, 83.1%]

STATISTICAL TESTS
----------------------------------------
  Chi-square test:
    Chi-square statistic: 3.75
    p-value: 0.2892
    Interpretation: No significant difference between structures

PAIRWISE COMPARISONS (Bonferroni corrected)
----------------------------------------
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize vs Independent → Majority Vote: -7.1% (p=0.3631)
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize vs Independent → Deliberate → Vote: -4.9% (p=1.0000)
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize vs Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: -3.7% (p=1.0000)
  Independent → Majority Vote vs Independent → Deliberate → Vote: +2.2% (p=1.0000)
  Independent → Majority Vote vs Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: +3.3% (p=1.0000)
  Independent → Deliberate → Vote vs Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: +1.2% (p=1.0000)

T-TESTS: STRUCTURES VS BEST INDIVIDUAL MODEL
----------------------------------------
  Best individual model: gemma-2-9b-it (73.3%)

  Rank → Synthesize: 74.6% vs 73.3% (diff=+1.3%, t=0.37, p=0.7106)
  Majority Vote: 81.7% vs 84.6% (diff=-2.9%, t=-1.22, p=0.2238)
  Deliberate → Vote: 79.5% vs 84.9% (diff=-5.4%, t=-2.15, p=0.0323)*
  Deliberate → Synthesize: 78.3% vs 82.1% (diff=-3.7%, t=-1.38, p=0.1704)

DELIBERATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
  Answer changes after deliberation:
    Total changes:        361
    Changed to correct:   174
    Changed to wrong:     106
    Net benefit:          +68 answers

  Agreement levels (groupthink indicator):
    Before deliberation:  80.8%
    After deliberation:   89.8%
    Change:               +9.0%

  By model (change rate | fix rate when wrong | break rate when correct):
    llama-3.1-8b-instruct: 28.7% | 49.4% | 7.1%
    mistral-7b-instruct: 18.3% | 38.2% | 5.7%
    gemma-2-9b-it: 23.0% | 43.0% | 14.3%
    qwen-2.5-7b-instruct: 12.3% | 24.2% | 3.9%

  Interpretation:
    Deliberation increases agreement (potential groupthink)
    Net positive: deliberation fixes more than it breaks (+68)
    Simple majority vote may outperform deliberation by preserving independence

----------------------------------------
  Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: mean=21.55s, std=13.32s
  Independent → Deliberate → Vote: mean=30.13s, std=73.56s
  Independent → Majority Vote: mean=13.20s, std=13.44s
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize: mean=18.47s, std=32.69s
