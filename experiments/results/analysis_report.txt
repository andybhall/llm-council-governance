ACCURACY WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
----------------------------------------
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize: 74.6% [68.7%, 79.7%]
  Independent → Majority Vote: 81.7% [76.3%, 86.1%]
  Independent → Deliberate → Vote: 79.5% [73.9%, 84.1%]
  Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: 78.3% [72.7%, 83.1%]

STATISTICAL TESTS
----------------------------------------
  Chi-square test:
    Chi-square statistic: 3.75
    p-value: 0.2892
    Interpretation: No significant difference between structures

PAIRWISE COMPARISONS (Bonferroni corrected)
----------------------------------------
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize vs Independent → Majority Vote: -7.1% (p=0.3631)
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize vs Independent → Deliberate → Vote: -4.9% (p=1.0000)
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize vs Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: -3.7% (p=1.0000)
  Independent → Majority Vote vs Independent → Deliberate → Vote: +2.2% (p=1.0000)
  Independent → Majority Vote vs Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: +3.3% (p=1.0000)
  Independent → Deliberate → Vote vs Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: +1.2% (p=1.0000)

T-TESTS: STRUCTURES VS BEST INDIVIDUAL MODEL
----------------------------------------
  Best individual model: gemma-2-9b-it (51.7%)

  Rank → Synthesize: 74.6% vs 51.7% (diff=+22.9%, t=5.71, p=0.0000)*
  Majority Vote: 81.7% vs 51.7% (diff=+30.0%, t=8.01, p=0.0000)*
  Deliberate → Vote: 79.5% vs 51.9% (diff=+27.6%, t=6.88, p=0.0000)*
  Deliberate → Synthesize: 78.3% vs 51.7% (diff=+26.7%, t=6.77, p=0.0000)*

DELIBERATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
  Answer changes after deliberation:
    Total changes:        455
    Changed to correct:   241
    Changed to wrong:     116
    Net benefit:          +125 answers

  Agreement levels (groupthink indicator):
    Before deliberation:  75.9%
    After deliberation:   86.7%
    Change:               +10.9%

  By model (change rate | fix rate when wrong | break rate when correct):
    llama-3.1-8b-instruct: 35.6% | 49.5% | 8.1%
    mistral-7b-instruct: 19.6% | 39.8% | 5.8%
    gemma-2-9b-it: 27.6% | 54.9% | 15.2%
    qwen-2.5-7b-instruct: 19.6% | 32.6% | 7.4%

  Interpretation:
    Deliberation increases agreement (potential groupthink)
    Net positive: deliberation fixes more than it breaks (+125)
    Simple majority vote may outperform deliberation by preserving independence

  Independent → Deliberate → Synthesize: mean=21.55s, std=13.32s
  Independent → Deliberate → Vote: mean=30.13s, std=73.56s
  Independent → Majority Vote: mean=13.20s, std=13.44s
  Independent → Rank → Synthesize: mean=18.47s, std=32.69s
